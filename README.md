The programs I made for these challenges only work when the corresponding challenge data is in a file called "data.txt", placed in the same directory as the executable.

Challenges from day 1 & 2 were written using .NET 7, and 3 & up using .NET 8 but they should all compile using at least .NET 7 (if not lower) unless specified.
